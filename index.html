        <p class="p1">
          Eminem has announced that his upcoming album “The Death of Slim Shady
          (Coup De Grâce)” will arrive on July 12. In a promo video for the
          album that the rapper posted to social media, a woman gives birth to a
          baby and it isn’t exactly a warm welcome to the world. As the mother
          holds the child, it opens its black eyes and cracks a sinister smile
          as horns emerge from its head.
